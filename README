strawperson is framework to get bring together TEI document curators, tool builders and validators

Many TEI projects have traditionally focused their own tools on their own
documents with a relatively small number of cross-collection tool 
builders building tools centrally, distributing tools and and collecting
bug reports and suggestions for improvement.

strawperson is a framework aiming to show that third-party tools can run 
over third-party documents and the outputs validated using third party 
tools.

strawperson works by collecting a range of TEI document from various sites 
around the internet (by preference getting the very latest versions from 
source control), getting a range of TEI transformations from sites around 
the internet (again from source control) and then running all the 
transformations on all the documents and validating the outputs.

It is hoped that this will encourage more regularisation of TEI encoding,
faster feedback loops between document creators / curators and tool 
builders and more cooperation between TEI projects.

There are a number of very simple documents and very simple transforms 
included in strawperson. 

The intention is to add more validators and better reporting on the results,
but that's not done yet. The intention is to also add more complex 
transformations such as the transformation used for the standard (is there
an official name for that?). Adding more documents from the list of samples 
at http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples is fairly straight-forward.

strawperson is primarily written as a series of makefiles.
